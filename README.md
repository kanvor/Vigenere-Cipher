# Vigenere-Cipher
This image shows a historical cipher table attributed to Blaise Pascal. Its name, “CHIFFRE INDÉCHIFRABLE,” means “Unbreakable Cipher.”

What does the table contain?

• A large table with double letters (probably a Vigenère or Playfair cipher).
• The French text below the table explains the principle of encryption:
• You use a secret word (in the example, “Paris”).
• The encryption works by shifting each letter according to the secret word.
• The result is unintelligible words that can only be deciphered with the key.

Translation of the French text below the table:

The use of this cipher is based on an agreed-upon word that can be changed letter by letter on each line.

Example:

Let’s assume the agreed-upon word is Paris.

• Je veux écrire… (I want to write…) → Vous serez demain au rendez-vous. (We will meet tomorrow.)
• Je mets… (I give…) → Pari s pari sparis pa rispar ispa.
• Voici ce que j’écris… (This is what I write…) → Umyq alini ploraf pé aefmxt oeuh.
• Celui qui recogniz la lettre met… (The recipient decrypts…) → Pari spari sparis pa rispar ispa.

And finally he says:

If UP is said, it means U. If MA is said, it means O.

What does it mean?

• It is probably a historical form of the Vigenère cipher.
• The secret word Paris is used to shift the letters in the message.
• The result is a seemingly random text that is only readable with the key.

Do you want us to test this table?

If you have some text to encrypt or want to try decrypting something, we can try it! 😊
